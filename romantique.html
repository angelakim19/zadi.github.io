        To My Dearest Zadi,</p>
      
        <p class="ty2">Happiest birthday, love! I am really grateful I swiped right at that time, HAHAAHA, because I was able to meet you. I'm really enjoying getting to know you more, even though we are miles apart.</p>

        <p class="ty3">Thank you for making me feel that I am capable of loving again. Youâ€™re such a blessing to me. Zadi, I know there are a lot of things you've been going through and doubts you have. But I am always here to listen to you and believe that you can overcome anything.</p>

        <p class="ty4">Enjoy the rest of your day, and I hope to see you soon, love. Happy birthday, and I love you!!</p>

        <p class="ty5">Angela<3</p>
